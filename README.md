# Chat Application using gRPC

## Overview

This project is a real-time chat application built using gRPC and Protocol Buffers. It supports both one-to-one messaging and broadcast messaging. The system is implemented in Go and also has a Python version. Docker is used for containerization, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Features

**Real-time messaging:** Supports direct (one-to-one) and broadcast messaging.

**gRPC for efficient communication:** Uses Protocol Buffers for fast and serialized message exchange.

**Dockerized deployment:** Easily deployable using Docker containers.

**Multi-language support:** Implemented in both Go and Python.

**Scalable architecture:** Designed with concurrency in mind, handling multiple connections efficiently.

## Technologies Used

**Go** for server and client implementation

**Python** alternative implementation

**gRPC & Protocol Buffers** for structured and high-performance communication

**Docker** for containerized deployment
